Getting Started with Create React App
This project combines the power of Create React App with a robust back-end built using Node.js and MongoDB Atlas.

## Front-end
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the running tests section for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
